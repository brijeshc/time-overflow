            Time Overflow is designed to help you track your time efficiently
            and improve your productivity. The core purpose of this app is to
            maintain honest time logging for yourself. It serves as a behavioral
            nudge to make you aware of how you spend your time, helping you
            consciously move towards a more productive lifestyle. The more you
            log your time, the better you'll understand your time allocation
            patterns. Not all activities fit neatly into productive, neutral, or
            wasteful categories. Some of our actions (Karma) have value beyond
            simple categorization. While the app isn't primarily designed to
            track quality family time or routine activities, you're welcome to
            log everything you wish. Here's how to maximize your experience with
            the app:

          <ThemedText style={[styles.subtitle, { color: textColor }]}>
            1. Logging Time
          </ThemedText>
          <ThemedText style={[styles.paragraph, { color: textColor }]}>
            Use the Tracker tab to log your activities. You can categorize them
            as productive, neutral, or wasteful based on your personal
            assessment. What's productive for one person might be considered
            wasteful for another - for instance, watching movies could be
            productive for a filmmaker.

          <ThemedText style={[styles.subtitle, { color: textColor }]}>
            2. Analyzing Data
          </ThemedText>
          <ThemedText style={[styles.paragraph, { color: textColor }]}>
            The Analytics tab offers detailed insights into your time usage
            patterns. Monitor how you allocate time across different activities
            and identify potential areas for improvement. Your productive score
            is calculated using a weighted average of productive, wasteful, and
            neutral activities.
          </ThemedText>
          <ThemedText style={[styles.subtitle, { color: textColor }]}>
            3. Setting Targets
          </ThemedText>
          <ThemedText style={[styles.paragraph, { color: textColor }]}>
            Establish daily targets for productive time and set limits for
            activities you consider wasteful. This feature helps maintain focus
            and achieve your personal goals.

            4. Pomodoro Timer üçÖ
          </ThemedText>
          <ThemedText style={[styles.paragraph, { color: textColor }]}>
            Boost your productivity with our Pomodoro Timer feature. This
            technique helps you stay focused by working in dedicated time
            blocks. Set custom durations between 2-90 minutes (default is 25
            minutes). Timer automatically logs your completed sessions as
            productive time. Pause, reset, or end your session at any time.
            Minimum 1 minute of focus required to log a session. Name your focus
            task to stay on track. The Pomodoro Timer is perfect for deep work
            sessions and helps you maintain concentration while automatically
            tracking your productive time.

            5. Exporting Data
          </ThemedText>
          <ThemedText style={[styles.paragraph, { color: textColor }]}>
            Access and export your logs for in-depth analysis or backup
            purposes. Your data remains accessible whenever you need it.
